I have created a user interface for Discord. I have created my own version of Discord, the goal is for it to be exactly like Discord but there is nothing that you have to pay for. The target audience is for young people.

It should not be possible to click on Friends in TabControl. The Friends Nitro and Shop buttons do not work.

It should be used exactly like Discord does.
